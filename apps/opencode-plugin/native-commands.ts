/**
 * Native slash commands for OpenCode 2.
 *
 * OpenCode's V2 plugin API gained command EXECUTION in anomalyco/opencode
 * PR #44765 (issue #2185): the command draft grew an `add({ name, description,
 * execute })` method whose callback fully owns the invocation, so nothing
 * reaches the model unless it says so. That shape currently ships only on the
 * `beta` and `dev` dist-tags of `@opencode-ai/plugin`; `next` and `latest`
 * still carry a draft of `{ list, get, update, remove }` with no `add`.
 *
 * `ctx.command.transform` therefore proves NOTHING: it exists on both. The only
 * honest probe is the draft handed to the callback, which is what this module
 * checks. On an older host it adds nothing and the markdown command stubs stay
 * the (model-mediated) fallback.
 *
 * Execution reuses the exact V1 machinery, `handleCliCommand`, over a
 * translation client, so the two hosts cannot drift.

/**
 * Take the three names back from the config-loaded markdown stubs.
 *
 * Mechanism, verified against anomalyco/opencode `origin/v2`:
 *  - Command definitions live in a name-keyed Map and `draft.add` is a
 *    `Map.set` (`packages/core/src/command.ts`), so the LAST transform to add a
 *    name wins.
 *  - Transforms replay in registration order: `transforms = [...transforms,
 *    transform]`, and `materialize` walks that array
 *    (`packages/core/src/state.ts`).
 *  - Activation order is `pre` -> packages -> `post`, and OpenCode's own
 *    ConfigCommandPlugin, which scans `~/.config/opencode/{command,commands}/
 *    **\/*.md`, sits in `post` (`packages/core/src/plugin/internal.ts:265-269`,
 *    `packages/core/src/plugin/supervisor.ts`).
 * So a setup-time transform ALWAYS replays before config's, and the stubs the
 * installer writes shadow the native definitions on every normal install. The
 * fix is to register the same transform once more after activation settles, so
 * ours is last in the replay order; from then on it stays last, because config
 * only ever calls `reload()` and never re-registers.
 *
 * The explicit `reload()` is belt and braces, not a requirement: each plugin's
 * effect runs inside `State.batch` (`packages/core/src/plugin.ts`), but the
 * batch clears its active flag before flushing, so a registration arriving
 * after that takes the direct path and materializes on its own. Calling
 * `reload()` anyway costs one recompute and removes any dependence on that
 * ordering detail holding in a future OpenCode.
 *
 * Deliberately not driven by `ctx.event.subscribe()`: upstream #44788 reports
 * that stream as unreliable on some V2 nightlies, and `command.list()` is a
 * direct read of committed state with no bus involved.
 *
 * Failure mode: if this never gets to run, or the host has no `list`/`reload`,
 * or a future OpenCode reorders activation, the markdown stubs keep winning and
 * the three commands still work through their model-mediated fallback bodies.
 * Degraded, never broken.

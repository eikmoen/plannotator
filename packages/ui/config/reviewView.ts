/**
 * The ONLY writers for the coupled setting pair (reviewPanelView,
 * defaultDiffType).
 *
 * Invariant: the Sections (Git status) view can only render the since-base
 * diff. So:
 *   - choosing the sections view forces defaultDiffType = 'since-base'
 *   - choosing a non-since-base default diff snaps the view to 'tree'
 *   - tree + since-base IS valid — switching to Tree leaves the diff, and
 *     choosing since-base leaves the view
 *
 * Hand-mirroring these rules at call sites is how the split-brain bug
 * happened (a writer persisted one half of the pair; configStore.init()
 * then re-corrupted it from the server every session). Never write either
 * setting directly — always go through these setters. configStore.init()
 * remains the one non-writer that can produce a conflicted pair from a
 * stale config.json; the App-level load reconciler heals that case by
 * calling setReviewPanelView('sections', { recordLastUsed: false }).
